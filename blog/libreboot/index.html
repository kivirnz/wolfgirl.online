    <p>Do you know why so many opsec enthusiasts use Lenovo Thinkpads?
      The reason why isn’t because they look cool (which they do), the
      reason why is because of something called the IME (Intel Management
      Engine)</p>
    <p>Essentially ever since 2008, IME has been embedded in every
      single commercial and most industrial Intel chipsets for a while
      now. IME is an autonomous subsystem process running Minix (Linux
      predecessor built for embedded firmwares) which runs even when the
      device is powered off and it is responsible for things like handling
      NFC communications, anti-theft technology and Secure Boot
      cryptography.</p>
    <p>“So” you may be asking, “do I need it on my system?” The answer
      is no.</p>
    <p>Everything that IME can do is already handled by at least three
      other chips or pieces of software in your PC. No laptop really
      utilises NFC, Intel Anti-Theft Technology was discontinued in 2015
      and Secure Boot is already handled by your BIOS. It serves zero
      purpose for existing.</p>
    <p>“Hmm” you ponder, “that’s strange, if it has no reason to exist,
      then why does it exist in the first place?” Great question, the
      answer is to spy on you.</p>
    <p>The EFF and many other internet privacy advocates have discovered
      that “the IME has full access to memory (without the
      owner-controlled CPU cores having any knowledge), and has full
      access to the TCP/IP stack and can send and receive network packets
      independently of the operating system, thus bypassing its firewall”
      In short, it has full access to every byte of data coming in and out
      of your system and you have zero control over it.</p>
    <p>Intel responded against these claims pretty much saying “we would
      never put backdoors into our systems” but considering their biggest
      contracts are with government agencies I personally put this on the
      same level that pigs can fly.</p>
    <p>Pile this on top of the fact that in the NSA Budget Request for
      2013, they detailed a Sigint Enabling Project with the goal to
      “Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT
      systems” and it is very much believed that this was referencing both
      IME and AMD’s similar product named the PSP (Platform Security
      Processor)</p>
    <p>Pile that on top of (unconfirmed) leaked Mossad documents
      detailing research and collaboration with US Cyber Command to create
      a backdoor for IME and AMD PSP which results show were
      successful.</p>
    <p>In short, it has every single byte of data in your device passing
      through it, and it has zero purpose other than to give glowniggers a
      way to spy on you, fantastic.</p>
    <p>“Ok” you say “I gotta get rid of this now, is there a way to
      disable it?” Not officially…</p>
    <p>Intel currently has zero support for people disabling the IME and
      they have stuck by that for many years, all the source code they use
      as well as the customised version of Minix they use for the embedded
      firmware is all closed source too. So how can we disable it?</p>
    <p>There are a couple of ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Libreboot/Coreboot</li>
      <li>me_cleaner</li>
      <li>HAP/undocumented mode</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s start with me_cleaner, to put it very simply IME may sound
      scary but it is designed very very stupidly. The integrity
      verification system is broken, that is pretty much the part that
      allows the IME chip to check if it has been tampered with, and if it
      has detected it was tampered with, it forces the PC to shut down for
      30 minutes. However there is a loophole where it gives you a grace
      period to re-flash the IME firmware and fix the problem. However
      this is where it gets stupid as if you corrupt the firmware of the
      IME just right, you can trigger it into an abnormal error state
      where the firmware is corrupted beyond repair but it does not shut
      down your system. Very very clever.</p>
    <p>Now for the most ironic, HAP/undocumented mode. So Intel has
      blatantly admitted that the IME has a special mode in it known as
      ‘HAP mode’ (High-Assurance Platform mode) which was made for US
      government agencies to disable IME on their devices only and was
      only intended to be available only in machines produced for specific
      purchasers like the government agencies. The issue is even though
      there isn’t any public documentation by Intel, you can access the
      HAP mode on most retail Intel chipsets, essentially disabling IME
      simply because the government wanted it haha. Priceless. The HAP
      mode was quickly implemented into the me_cleaner project though.</p>
    <p>Now the third and most accessible way is via Libreboot/Coreboot.
      Coreboot is an BIOS replacement which is meant to replace OEM BIOS
      firmwares with a free and open source alternative. However Coreboot
      has an option to disable the IME partly using the me_cleaner source
      code and partly their own funky magic. Meanwhile Libreboot
      automatically just disables the IME by default. Some devices can not
      completely disable the IME, but rather just heavily limit what
      information it stores and has access to, so that at maximum the IME
      can only receive 26 bytes of information a second, which doesn’t
      completely disable the IME but it does stunt it and make it
      essentially useless. Libreboot is a fork of Coreboot that does not
      allow binary blobs (binaries of proprietary software) which makes it
      slightly better. To install Libreboot or Coreboot, you need a CH341A
      programmer to write directly to the SPI flash of the BIOS chip. It
      is not a simple BIOS update sadly but it is very much worth it.</p>
    <p>Back to the main point though, the reason why so many opsec
      enthusiasts use Thinkpads is that while there are builds for both
      Libreboot and Coreboot for many different devices including Macs and
      Chromebooks, the biggest range is on the Lenovo Thinkpad series,
      pair that with an award winning keyboard, cheap cost and the sheer
      volume manufactured, there is your recipe for why it is the goto for
      opsec enthusiasts.</p>
    <p>In short, Intel ME (and AMD’s version of it known as PSP) are
      processes in your chipset running small embedded firmwares and every
      single byte of data in your computer has to travel through it. This
      makes the Intel ME a massive security burden as it is plagued with
      not only vulnerabilities but also backdoors which Intel were forced
      to install by government agencies. Intel makes it almost impossible
      to disable it but there are ways to do it and most of those methods
      work on old Thinkpads which is why they are so popular in opsec and
      internet privacy culture.</p>
